### About the Images

I am collecting them from various sites and I am not sure about the licensing requirements.

Some (*and not all*) background images have been downloaded from <http://subtlepatterns.com/>; itâ€™s a great site, you should definitely check that if you have a thing for patterns.

If, by any chance, you happen to own any of these images, please let me know so that  I can give proper credit to where its due.
